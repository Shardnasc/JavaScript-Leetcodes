# JavaScript-Leetcodes
This is what I am doing for technical interviews. Looking forward to it.

I did one problem for sleep- https://leetcode.com/problems/sleep/
(Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.)

Another problem is: https://leetcode.com/problems/counter/
(Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).

They were labeled as easy problems, but apparently, my logic needs a lot of work to solve them.
